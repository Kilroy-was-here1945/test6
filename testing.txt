test 1
I was seeing some issues with the "see all bots" button. I tested it by clicking the button after running the file in local host and running the server file.
Then all of the robots should showed up. After testing all of the robots showed up.


test 2
I plan to test the "draw" button and it should show 5 robots after pressed. after localhost:3000 is ran and draw button is clicked. 
results
the test was successful all bots showed up.

test 3
I plan to click the "draw" button and see if the robots show up. then click on two robots and see if the card changes to a card that has a "remove" button on it.
then I will click the battle button and see if a winning message shows up marking up the number of wins on the browser or losing message marking up the number of
loses on the browser.

test 4
does the styling work on the browser.

extra notes 
// botsArr was not defined but then I found there was no botsArr so I found the bot arr in data.js and changed botsArr in the shuffle function
// I tested whether or not app get bots were working by console logging bots
// I tried to look and see why winner was not increasing and if it was defined
// I looked for some text and saw that the index.js had a wins button and looked for other spots it existed and found that there was a wins
